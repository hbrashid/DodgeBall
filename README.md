** Don't forget to 'npm i' so the tests work in node **

We are in need of a sorting and organizing app for our community dodge ball league. There are already 6 players signed up and we hope to get more! We need to select from our currently sign-up people to make them dodge ball players and from there we need to be able to select them to be on different teams. Please look over the Specs Checklist to make sure you understand the needs of this app.

1. We have a players column, where we can move people to, from a people column. They they get 'player' values.
2. Can add players to teams, such as the blue or red team. They also get the properties 'color' and 'mascot', along with the other properties from player, via extend and super.
3. Use 'Class' for new properties and use extend when needed. We will use class for Player and then extend to Red and Blue Teammate. 

Need to create a class, that has canThrowBall, canDodgeBall, hasPaid, isHealthy, yearsExperience.
Then these are pushed to a new array, and displayed in the DOM.
Button will be added to select team for player.
We will need to create a blue and red team button. And then remove and apply the player to the appropriate team.
